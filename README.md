### overview ### 
You are melvin, a little guy with a big umbrella.

Melvin loves the night sky, but he noticed that some stars are out of place. Try to collect all the stars before the sun come up-- but watch out for the monster!

Use the arrow keys to jump and move left/ right, and try to collect all the yellow stars. Game ends when you reach the sky (about a minute), collect all 100 coins, fall off the platforms, or lose all lives (the monster's body is safe to touch, but getting hit by a bullet will cost a life).
